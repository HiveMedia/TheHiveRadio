    <hr/>
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The following is a brief set of guidelines regarding the rights, responsibilities, tools and rules for
    staff working at The Hive Radio. Repeated violations of the following rules will result in a warning,

    <h2>Foreword</h2>

    <p>Hello! We want to personally thank you for your interest in our organization, and welcome
    you to our family. The Hive Radio is a station that strives to unite our followers with the
    amazing music and video content that todays pop culture groups make and show off to
    the world. It is the product of the hard work on many people, and whether you are new to
    the staff or have been around since day one, we glad that you are a part of our family.</p>

    <p>A bit of history: The Hive Radio was founded by Connor (better know as Blacjak21) and
    Liam (also know as TheAuzzieBrony, or Auzzie for short), these two brought together a
    awesome team of staff that made The Hive Radio what it is today. The Hive Radio was
    live to the public on the 10th of October 2013. The Hive Radio prides itself on being
    Australian run and owned, which is what helps make as unique and inviting! We are
    excited to have you with us. Though the future may be bumpy, as a family, we will stick
    together and work things out together.</p>

    <p>Again, welcome to our family.<br/>
    ­ The Hive Radio, A station by changelings, for everyone!</p>

    <h1>Rules, Regulations and Guidelines (RRG)</h1>
    <hr/>
    <h2>1. Show Host Representation</h2>

    <p>The Hive Radio exists to serve the internet and all the pop cultures that exist on it with
    content beyond a simple music stream. You will be required to provide more than that
    which our AutoDJ can do on its own, and to do so with grace, style and poise.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A. You are required to provide the Head of Production with an up-to-date
        topic of what you plan to do with your airtime</li>

        <li>B. There are no restrictions on types of content allowed within the bounds
        defined in section 4. Be creative!</li>

        <li>C. You must show respect to the audience, your fellow staff and everyone
        else. Being a part of The Hive Radio, your behavior reflects onto the station
        and its staff</li>

        <li> D. We require our show hosts to be equipped with clear microphones, and
        to have them tuned to neither be too quiet (muffled) nor to sensitive (loud,
        crackly). If your mic is particularly sensitive, consider investing in a pop
        filter.</li>

        <li>E. We require staff that are on-air to be logged into the IRCBot Client
        during the duration of a stream. Technical issues that cause lag-outs or
        other problems for IRC are understandable.
        <ul>
            <li>You are required to have the bot count you in before you go on air, this
        helps keep the stream nice and smooth. If you need help doing this contact
        production.</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Open Door Policy</h2>

    <p>Your leaders, despite their faults, care about you and make themselves available to you
    as often as their busy schedules allow. We ask that if you have a question, comment,
    concern or suggest, you bring it to us without hesitation.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A. In return for the opportunity to work with us and all the demands on our
        time, we ask that you please listen attentively and follow orders without
        have to be told more than once</li>

        <li>B. If a staff member has an issue with other stations or their staff, please
        do not hesitate to bring it up with the Head of Production or the Director
        of The Hive Radio</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>3. Administrative Action</h3>

    <p>Everything that goes on in regards to The Hive Radio is subject to review by the
    administration board. The reach of the administration board in regards to the operation of
    The Hive Radio, it’s streams and chats is universal and any issue in regards to those will
    be discussed and dealt with immediately at the discretion of the administration board.
    Show host credentials can be added, suspended and removed by the Head of Production
    (with permission from the administration board) at anytime, for any reason. The involved
    parties will be alerted as to the reason of removal/suspension of their credentials at the
    time of the act.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A. Dismissal from The Hive Radio will not be immediate. The involved
        parties will be given a warning, receive counseling from the
        administrators, or (if offense is repeated on multiple occasions) dismissal
        will be implemented. Warnings are not guaranteed. Depending on the
        severity of the offense, the administration board may see it necessary to
        proceed directly to counseling. Or, if the issue warrants extreme situations,
        the administration board may proceed directly to dismissal with notice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Quality Control</h3>

    <p>Show hosts are required to keep their shows rated PG13 while on air. A show may have
    a content rating higher but the show host must talk with the Head of Production about the
    matter before hand to organise how the show shall be run.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A. Do not, under any circumstance, in any degree of jest, make any
        comment of racist, sexist, ableist, xenophobic or homophobic nature while
        on-air or while representing The Hive Radio and it partners and affiliates.
        As a media outlet it is imperative that we make a proactive attempt to set
        a positive example in our treatment of others</li>

        <li>B. Explicit sexual content is strictly prohibited at all times. Subtle allusions
        and tame, gentle discussion of sexuality are allowed, but use care and
        discretion</li>

        <li>C. The broadcast of professionally labeled music and content (without prior
        explicit permission from the artist and the administration board) is to be
        avoided per copyright concerns (exceptions listed in the following
        subsections)
        <ul>
            <li>(I) Show hosts can play any length of copyrighted music, under the condition
            that it is modified in some way enough to call it remix or mashup. Do it in a
            proper mix and it will be ok</li>

            <li>(II) Show hosts can play any music by artist that have given permission to the
            Ponyville Live! Network (http://pvlive.me/pvl_artists) and any music from
            Hive aproved artists (you can request a list from
            liam.haworth@hivemedia.net.au)</li>

        </ul></li>
        <li>D. Loud and obscene music is prohibited on air, such as the scream and
        death metal genre. If there are any discrepancies on a song and whether it
        is allowed, bring it up with production (liam.haworth@hivemedia.net.au)</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>5. Staff Chat Room Requirements</h2>

    <p>Due to The Hive Radio being a online organisation with staff from all over the globe we
    use Skype to stay in contact with each other. If you do not have a skype account or would
    like one for The Hive Radio only use please contact The Hive Radio’s director
    (liam.haworth@hivemedia.net.au) and a work account shall be created along with a
    personal e­mail address for work use.</p>

    <p>Being included in the staff groups you are to acknowledge that The Hive Radio skype
    group chat is a workplace and is to be treated with respect. The quality guidelines
    outlined in section 4 and its subsections apply to all workplace chats.</p>

    <h2>6. On Air Guests</h2>

    <p>Having guests on air during a session is up to the discretion of the streamer. On air
    guests MUST follow the RRG listed in this handbook (no exceptions). Any violation of the
    RRG by an on­air guest falls on the streamer, as it is the responsibility of the streamer to
    ensure the guests follow the RRG.</p>

    <h2>8. For-Profit vs Non-For-Profit</h2>

    <p>For clarification, The Hive Radio is a Non­For­Profit, this means that any and all
    donations and moneys received under the name “The Hive Radio” goes into a account
    that is looked after by the administration board. These moneys are used ONLY for
    expenses required to run and maintain The Hive Radio (e.g. monthly server costs,
    multimedia content purchases, etc.).</p>

    <p>The Hive Radio is a sub­project of Hive Media Productions, a Australian based media
    productions team. The staff members that are on the Hive Radio administration board
    are also the founders on Hive Media Productions. Hive Media Productions is For­Profit
    but is run completely separate from The Hive Radio, the only time that Hive Media
    Productions will step into the operation of The Hive Radio is in the event of a major
    problem (running costs, serious complaints about operation, etc.).</p>

    <p>If you have any more concerns or questions on the matter, contact Liam Haworth
    (liam.haworth@hivemedia.net.au)</p>

    <h2>9. Other Policies</h2>

    <p>This Policy replaces the “Hive Radio Hand Book 17/12/13”<br/>
    This Policy updates “The Hive Radio ­ Staff Handbook” April 2014 edition</p>
