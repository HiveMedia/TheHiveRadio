                    <p>You may be asking who we are. Well let me explain a bit about us....</p>
                    <p>We are a station for everyone from every fandom and further, but here’s a bit of history of how we came to be. The Hive Radio made its very first public appearance in October 2013 when Blacjak21 and TheAuzzieBrony devised a plan to form a new and completely Australian owned online radio station (they hoped).
                        From the start the radio was heavily based on music and content from the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic fandom, but in February 2014 the heads of Hive felt it was time to expand and move away from just pony music and start providing more variety  and a wider range of pop culture music and content.</p>
                    <p>We hope to continue expanding with more music and content to provide to our listeners.

                    <p>We strive to bring you the best content and services and we hope you enjoy what we have to provide.</p>
